## Stack
- Node.js
- Express
- Docker
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Docker Compose (for local development)

## What This Project Does
- Automatically builds and tests on every push to `main`
- Uses GitHub Actions to simulate production-ready CI/CD
- Local development with Docker Compose

## Run Locally

```bash
docker-compose up --build

```
- App will be available at: http://localhost:3000

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Trigger: Push to main
- Steps: Install â†’ Lint â†’ Test â†’ Docker Build

## Folder Structure
- app/ â€“ Contains the Node.js express app
- .github/workflows/ â€“ CI/CD pipeline YAML

## GitHub Actions Pipeline
